A 21-year-old man was found guilty on Wednesday of killing his friend at the Silverlake construction site where they worked, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office.

After deliberating for less than two hours, Christian Valdez, a Latino, was found guilty of second-degree murder.

In May 2014, Valdez showed up to work drunk and was ordered to go home. He borrowed Juan Sanchez’s car and crashed into a parked vehicle, according to prosecutors. Sanchez expected that Valdez would cover the repair costs.

On May 22, Valdez came back to work at a construction site in the 4200 block of Burns Avenue and bludgeoned Sanchez with a hammer.

According to The Eastsider, Sanchez grew up in Echo Park. Friends described him as hardworking and funny. He had a young daughter.

Valdez, who faces 15 years to life in prison, is expected to be
sentenced May 4.
